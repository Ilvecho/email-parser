# Email Parser

I am very passionate about AI, and I am trying to keep up with the industry as much as possible. 
I also try to stay up to date with the major economics and politics pieces of news. 
In order to achieve the above, I have few newsletters that come in (almost) daily.

The problem is that I am a slow reader, while I am a fast listener.
Hence, I want to turn my newsletters into audio to be able to consume them in my favorite format. 

Furthermore, of the newsletters, I am interested in only few sections/titles - to read through the whole content it would be too much information.
Therefore, before turning the text into audio, I also perform extensive parsing and filtering to keep only the parts that are really relevant to me. 

Can the parsing and filtering be improved? 
Of course it can. Is it worth the time (and eventual money for the LLM API call)? I don't think so. 

Can the TTS conversion be improved? 
Of course it can. ElevenLabs is always available, but also ~10 times more expensive.
