The Neuron

Y‚Äôall remember when Snapchat filters hit the scene, and fundamentally changed the selfie? Well, we‚Äôre seeing some early signs that ‚ÄúAI filters‚Äù could soon do the same.
Yesterday, we briefly mentioned[ Pika], one of the top AI video generators, then lo and behold, they just launched something new: It‚Äôs called [Pikaswaps], and it‚Äôs basically the genAI equivalent of the Snapchat filter. Check it out:
Youtube: Introducing Pikaswaps!
Apparently, Pika already has 12M+ users (_WILD!), _and just dropped its first[ iOS app] to create mind-bending videos on the go. Think turning selfies into memes, adding fantastical elements ([like Yoda]) to real footage, or transforming photos into dynamic videos with just a text prompt.
Oh, and btw, don‚Äôt forget that Google also just made it so[ creators can use its Veo 2 video generator] to create background filters for videos. _Friendly reminder to no longer trust anything you see!_
**Here‚Äôs what you need to know about AI today:**
* GPT-4.5 is imminent and ChatGPT now has 400M monthly active users.
* Figure demo‚Äôd robots working together using a single AI system.
* Spotify added ElevenLabs AI voices for audiobooks.
* Sakana AI made GPU code run up to 100x faster.

# GPT-4o is‚Ä¶ _different_, but at least GPT-4.5 is coming any day now‚Ä¶
Only looking at the headlines, you could argue OpenAI hasn‚Äôt had the best two weeks; first, Elon [tried to disrupt] its non-profit to for-profit transition by [offering to purchase] the non-profit. Then, Elon [released Grok 3] and claimed it achieved early benchmarks outperforming OpenAI‚Äôs models.
Even OpenAI‚Äôs [new benchmark] for freelance software engineers was [one-upped by Claude] Sonnet.
While all this _might*_ have caused some scrambling behind the scenes, it doesn‚Äôt seem to have impacted the core business of selling AI.
**Because by all accounts, OpenAI is crushing it: **As OpenAI‚Äôs COO Brad Lightcap says, ChatGPT is now up to [400M weekly active users]. And that‚Äôs [not all]:
1. 2M+ business users now wield ChatGPT for work.
2. Reasoning Model API usage increased 5x since o3-mini went live.
3. GPT-5, when it goes live ‚Äúsoon,‚Äù will be totally free with no usage caps.
Confused about why OpenAI would give away GPT-5 for free? Turns out Pro and Plus users will get more inference (the time ChatGPT takes to generate its answers) for more complicated tasks.
Right now, OpenAI does this via ‚Äúlow,‚Äù ‚Äúmedium,‚Äù and ‚Äúhigh‚Äù settings, but a slider scale like [Anthropic plans to release] with its new Claude model is a lot more user-friendly.
**Speaking of GPT-5**‚ÄîAccording to a [report by The Verge], it looks like Microsoft is prepping OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 models to go live on its Azure servers as you read this.
GPT-4.5 may be on its way, but a new GPT-4o is already here.** **As Ethan Mollick shared, [something's different about GPT-4o], but OpenAI isn't saying what. Sam hinted at this [with a cryptic tweet], but there‚Äôs no real evidence in the usual places ([LM Leaderboard], [OpenAI‚Äôs own records]).


**Here‚Äôs what we know about the update: **
* GPT-4o seems generally ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù and less likely to refuse requests.
* Many specialized custom GPTs (like AI illustrators) are completely broken.
* Ethan‚Äôs [Innovation GPT] w/ 10K+ users stopped working entirely).
* Text-based GPTs appear mostly unaffected.
* No official documentation or warning was provided about the changes.
This creates a thorny problem for businesses building on OpenAI's tech. Some devs are already jumping ship to open-source alternatives like [DeepSeek] or [Llama], where they can host their own models and avoid surprise updates breaking their products.
**Our take:** This is the double-edged sword of working with OpenAI. We want better models, but those ~2M business users need stability. With GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 on the horizon, OpenAI will need to figure out how to roll out some [pretty big changes] without disrupting the ecosystem they've built.
_Worth noting: OpenAI released a _[_major update_]_ to the _[_Model Spec_]_ on February 12th that could have something to do with this‚Ä¶_


# Prompt Tip of the Day
In a recent competition hosted by Google, [Swedish Prompt Championship finalist] Joakim Jardenberg crushed 300+ competitors.
**His winning framework turns conventional prompting wisdom on its head:**
* Think of AI as an eager junior colleague sitting across from you, not a robot.
* Guide it like an intern‚Äîstay engaged, answer questions, and give real-time feedback instead of just dropping instructions.
* Match the AI's personality and capabilities like you would a human teammate's strengths.
* Don't over-structure every prompt‚Äîsometimes, vague instructions unlock surprising creative solutions.
* Actually talk to your AI (_yes, literally dictate prompts _via Advanced Voice Mode) instead of typing for more natural communication.
**Our favorite insight:** Jardenberg discovered he wasn't getting help from AI‚Äî_he_ was helping the AI. This mindset shift transformed his results from merely good to _championship-caliber. _Try it out!


# Around the Horn.
Youtube: Introducing Helix
* [Figure] demonstrated its ‚ÄúHelix AI‚Äù, a single neural network for all tasks and robots, in a new video that shows how two robots work together to put away groceries.
* [Spotify] will now accept AI-narrated audiobooks made with [ElevenLabs' voices]‚Äîtwo years ago, it made a [similar deal] with Google Play Books.
* [Sakana AI] created an AI system called [The AI CUDA Engineer] that makes GPU code run 10-100x faster.


# Intelligent Insights
Youtube: Majorana 1 Explained: The Path to a Million Qubits
* A[ paper] from DeepSeek presented a new attention mechanism that achieved an 11.6x speedup on long text (64K context) by carefully aligning an algorithm with how GPUs actually process data.
* [The EU AI Act] contains a copyright exemption for ‚Äútext and data mining‚Äù that big tech companies can use to train AI without permission or payment.
* A new AI algorithm called [Torque clustering] can find hidden patterns in complex data without human guidance ([read more]).
* The EFF argues that expanding copyright to defend against AI is a ‚Äú[snake oil solution]‚Äù that would cause more problems than it solves, while suggesting focused regulation in specific problem areas (privacy, labor, environment, antitrust) would be more effective to address legit concerns about AI's impact.

WALMART Walmart Posts Banner Holiday Showing To Cap Off 2024, Errs On Side Of Caution For 2025

Few had a better 2024 than the world‚Äôs largest retailer, Walmart , which saw its stock rise 72% for its best year since 1998 . That boom was on the backs of double-digit growth in its e-commerce sales and new global advertising business, while single-digit growth in its namesake stores helped move the needle. But few firms can drive repeat returns quite like this ‚Äî and they‚Äôre gainfully aware of that.

No repeat rally: In the fourth quarter, Walmart posted a banner holiday showing, with revenues up 4.1% year-over-year to $180.6B. In recent weeks, headlines have pinned this number down, as close e-commerce competitor Amazon was seen surpassing Walmart to become the S&P 500‚Äôs largest revenue-generating firm . However, the wholesale giant‚Äôs full-year haul ‚Äî $681B ‚Äî remained the best annual performance of any publicly traded firm in the US. And unlike some firms bringing in Big Tech money, the company prioritized returning billions to investors rather than sinking money into still-unprofitable AI ventures.

In FY 2025, Walmart raked in a record $29.3B in operating income ‚Äî it spent 37.9% of this on dividends and share buybacks to investors during the period. The corporation also authorized a 13% increase in its annual dividend for the coming fiscal year, which will bring the dividend to $0.94 per share (0.9%). 2025, Beware

However, not everything was sunshine and daisies for the big-box retailer. It warned of pressures coming this year, its FY 2026, issuing a cloudier outlook than investors were hoping for ‚Äî especially after the year it just had.

Walmart put forward another conservative outlook ‚Äî just as it did in FY 2024 and 2025 ‚Äî with net sales expected to rise 3% to 4%, while analysts were looking for 4% . The company said that although business remains strong and consumers are ‚Äúresilient,‚Äù there are ‚Äústill uncertainties related to consumer behavior and global economic and geopolitical conditions.‚Äù

Reading between the lines: Walmart‚Äôs guidance does not include expectations about planned tariffs, which CFO John Rainey feels ‚Äúreally good‚Äù about its ability to navigate. However, they qualify ‚Äî they will have an impact on the organization. And if the economy continues to show signs of trouble, it will likely crop up in reduced spending, especially from lower-income shoppers.

 ü©∏ Hims & Hers Draws Blood In Lab Testing Battle, Stock Up 558%

Skip the waiting room ‚Äî Hims & Hers just turned your living room into a lab. The telehealth disruptor snatched up Trybe Labs Wednesday , adding FDA-cleared at-home blood testing to its arsenal. Following its GLP-1 release and controversial Super Bowl ad, the move aims to tackle a critical healthcare barrier head-on ‚Äî sending $HIMS soaring 20% to record highs.

The acquisition expands Hims‚Äô testing capabilities to include hormone levels, cardiac risk, stress markers, liver function, and prostate health ‚Äî with rollout planned over the next year. Users will receive a blood lancet device that attaches to the upper arm and collects whole blood samples with a single button press ‚Äî leveraging anonymized blood work data to accelerate its MedMatch AI platform.

There will be blood: Hims & Hers‚Äô leap into at-home testing plugs a critical gap in its end-to-end ecosystem ‚Äî which spans prescriptions, skincare, supplements, and telehealth consultations. By integrating lab data, the company aims to ‚Äúdeepen insights‚Äù for personalized patient care. With profitable operations and a 558.5% one-year stock surge, this latest venture isn‚Äôt about stopping the bleeding ‚Äî it‚Äôs about giving legacy healthcare a taste of its own medicine.

üîÆ Microsoft Makes Quantum Leap With New Chip, Majorana 1

Imagine a computer that can solve in seconds what today‚Äôs fastest machines would need centuries to crack: a computer that can cure all cancers. That‚Äôs no longer science fiction, as Microsoft unveiled ‚Äú Majorana 1 ‚Äù ‚Äî a breakthrough chip that promises to tame the notoriously unstable quantum underworld within ‚Äúyears, not decades.‚Äù

Majorana 1‚Äôs 1% error rate is ‚Äúmore stable‚Äù and ‚Äúless prone to errors‚Äù compared to competitors ‚Äî pioneering a quality-over-quantity approach that Microsoft believes is more scaleable. The announcement gave life to falling quantum stocks like D-Wave , Quantum Computing , and Rigetti , up 13%, 1.6%, and 4% yesterday, respectively.

Quantum questions: With just eight qubits, Microsoft‚Äôs stable-first approach contrasts sharply with IBM and Google‚Äôs quantum goliaths, posting 1,121 and 105 qubits, respectively ‚Äî showcasing how quantum computing‚Äôs theoretical path to real-world impact remains as uncertain as a quantum state itself. Early enterprise adopters face a classic innovator‚Äôs dilemma ‚Äî invest billions in unproven tech or risk trailing the quantum leaps. For now, Wall Street‚Äôs quantum fever could be more speculation than calculation.

CHART COVID Deaths Created An Unexpected $205B Windfall for The Social Security Fund

The pandemic‚Äôs toll on life also left a mark on retirement funds. A recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that, due to COVID-related mortality, Social Security is projected to pay out $205B less in future benefits. The reduction in pension payouts, driven by premature deaths, is set to strengthen the program‚Äôs fiscal health.

Between 2020 and 2023, 1.7M excess deaths among Americans over 25 reduced retirement payments by $294B, though increased survivor benefits and lost tax revenue partially offset this. Although the reduction is just a small part of Social Security‚Äôs $1.6T in annual benefit payments, it still could provide a modest improvement in the program‚Äôs finances.

The long haul: The pandemic‚Äôs influence on Social Security extends beyond mortality statistics. Long COVID‚Äôs effect on workforce participation could strain the system, as affected individuals increasingly tap disability benefits and potentially contribute less. USC‚Äôs Hanke Heun-Johnson noted that many of the deceased ‚Äúwere drawing retirement benefits, or were going to withdraw retirement benefits, and they had already paid into the system.‚Äù The research team emphasizes these savings are ‚Äúmodest‚Äù ‚Äî a sobering reminder that even this substantial sum offers limited relief to the program‚Äôs long-term funding challenges.
