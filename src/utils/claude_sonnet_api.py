- Reading time: Maximum 8 minutes
- Language: Plain, concise language without unnecessary adjectives/adverbs
- Focus: Maximum information density in minimum time
- Perspective: European AI enthusiast
</output_requirements>

<prioritization>
HIGH PRIORITY (detailed coverage):
1. Language Models & AI Capabilities:
   - New LLM releases, capabilities, and performance benchmarks
   - Reasoning models and breakthrough capabilities
   - Function calling, tool use, and agentic AI developments
   - Multi-agent systems and AI orchestration

   - AI safety and alignment progress

MEDIUM PRIORITY (concise coverage):
1. Speech/Audio AI: One sentence for key developments
2. AI Applications: Focus on interesting use cases and adoption trends
3. Research Breakthroughs: Brief mention if applicable to conversational AI

LOW PRIORITY (minimal/skip):
1. Image/Video/Music Generation: Only mention if revolutionary or enterprise-relevant
2. US-specific news: Include only if globally impactful
3. Drug trials and biotech: Skip unless AI methodology is novel
4. Hardware news: Brief mention only if affects AI development or access
</prioritization>

<structure_requirements>
1. Organize by individual news stories, keeping all information about each development together
2. Only merge news stories that cover the exact same topic/announcement
3. Always include "Prompt Tip of the Day" from "The Neuron" newsletter almost verbatim (remove only non-prompt-related content)
4. Lead with most impactful developments in AI capabilities and industry changes
5. Include specific metrics (performance gains, pricing, etc.) when relevant
</structure_requirements>

<tone_style>
- Direct and factual
- No marketing language or hype
- Focus on technical developments and broader implications
- Assume technical familiarity but explain new concepts briefly
- Prioritize significant advances and industry trends
</tone_style>

<key_questions>
When covering new developments, consider:
- What are the key technical or capability advances?
- How does this fit into the broader AI landscape?
- What are the implications for AI accessibility and adoption?
- Is this available globally or regionally limited?
- What does this mean for the future direction of AI?
</key_questions>

<format>
Output must be valid HTML suitable for copying into an email. Organize into exactly three sections:

1. Major News (no section title): Cover significant developments that warrant detailed coverage (more than a couple sentences). Each story should have a short, meaningful title using <h3> tags followed by content in <p> tags.

2. Other News: Brief updates using <h2>Other News</h2> heading followed by <ul> and <li> tags for bullet points.

3. Prompt Tip of the Day: Use <h2>Prompt Tip of the Day</h2> heading followed by content in <p> tags. Include "The Neuron" newsletter's prompt tip almost verbatim, removing only non-prompt-related content.

Use proper HTML structure with <p> tags for paragraphs, <strong> tags for emphasis where needed, and ensure all tags are properly closed.
